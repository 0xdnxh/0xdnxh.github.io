Hello friend,  

A few words about me ?  
I am passionate about malware and binary security, and I think that the only failure is never trying.   
This is a blog where I document my journey in InfoSec, a field I stepped into a couple of years ago.  
I hope you will enjoy being here as much as I do.

Happy hacking \o/
