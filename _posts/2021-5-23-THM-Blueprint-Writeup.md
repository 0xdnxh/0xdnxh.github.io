## Introduction

In this blog post you will find a writeup for the [Blueprint](https://tryhackme.com/room/blueprint) room on TryHackMe. It's a Windows machine running a vulnerable version of osCommerce, an online store solution. Since this room isn't guided like the other ones, you will find my own steps.

## Enumeration
First we fire up nmap to get more info on the machine and find out open ports. The command that I used is ```nmap -sV -sC -Pn 10.10.7.76``` , the option -sV is used to determine service/version info, -sC to use the default script of nmap and -Pn to disable host discovery. The command outputs the following:

From this output we understand that the following interesting ports are open:
<ul>
  <li>80</li>
  <li>8080</li>
  <li>443</li>
</ul>

Navigating to http://10.10.7.76 , we get a Server error:

However, navigating to https://10.10.7.76 or 10.10.7.76:8080 we get the following page:

Interesting! So now we know there's an **osCommerce version 2.3.4** application running. Navigating inside the directory, we find two folders: catalog/ and docs/

### Fuzzing
Let's try to find which directories exist using dirb

Nothing really interesting. Let' go back to focusing on finding an exploit related to the version.

## Exploitation
Trying to find out if there are any exploit for osCommerce 2.3.4 using searchsploit, we come across some results that could potentially be helpful :

The last one **php/webapps/44374.py** looks interesting, it's a Remote code execution, we can find the complete code [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44374). Let's download it and take a look at it.

It looks like we could modify some PHP code in the **http://ipaddress/oscommerce-2.3.4.1/catalog/install/install.php** page and execute it. In the code, the payload tries to execute the **system("ls")** command to list the files on a Linux target. Let's try to replace it with a Windows PHP reverse shell. I used [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dhayalanb/windows-php-reverse-shell/master/Reverse%20Shell.php) and modified it accordingly so now it looks like this :

Let's fire up Metasploit and use **/multi/handler** to set up a listener on port 1234, accordingly to my modified script.

Let's run the exploit :

We load **configure.php** as indicated in the output and TADAAA we receive a shell on our listener :)

A shell is good but a Meterpreter session is better as it will allow us to run tools. We use the command ```sessions -u 7``` where 7 is our session ID :

Great ! So now we have a Meterpreter sessions we can interact with. Ã›sing hashdump we are able to retrieve hashes on the system :
